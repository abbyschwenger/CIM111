"I am on the water. I am in a boat with eight other driven and dedicated women and we are indomitable. We row as one - smoothly, crisply, artfully. We fly and glide across the water with grace and power. Each of us senses every movement of the others. Our oars fall into the water at precisely the same moment and our legs drive together, swiftly pulling the boat through our puddles. We release together, skillfully drawing our oars out of the water in preparation for the next stroke. We are one - one team, one boat, one stroke, one when we win, one when we lose, always one."

          Rowers classified as "lightweights" are under 130lbs (females) or under 150lbs (males). These rowers compete within their weight class for some of the fairest competition in the sport.
